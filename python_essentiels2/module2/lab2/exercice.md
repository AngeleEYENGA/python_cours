# Scenario 
You've surely seen a seven-segment display.

It's a device (sometimes electronic, sometimes mechanical) designed to present one decimal digit using a subset of seven segments. If you still don't know what it is, refer to the following Wikipedia article.

Your task is to write a program which is able to simulate the work of a seven-display device, although you're going to use single LEDs instead of segments.

Each digit is constructed from 13 LEDs (some lit, some dark, of course) - that's how we imagine it:

  # ### ### # # ### ### ### ### ### ### 
  #   #   # # # #   #     # # # # # # # 
  # ### ### ### ### ###   # ### ### # # 
  # #     #   #   # # #   # # #   # # # 
  # ### ###   # ### ###   # ### ### ###

* Note: the number 8 shows all the LED lights on.

Your code has to display any non-negative integer number entered by the user.

* Tip: using a list containing patterns of all ten digits may be very helpful.
```
digits = [ '1111110',  	# 0
	   '0110000',	# 1
	   '1101101',	# 2
	   '1111001',	# 3
	   '0110011',	# 4
	   '1011011',	# 5
	   '1011111',	# 6
	   '1110000',	# 7
	   '1111111',	# 8
	   '1111011',	# 9
	   ]


def print_number(num):
    # Write the function here.
