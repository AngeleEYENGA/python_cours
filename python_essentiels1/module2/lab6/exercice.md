# Estimated Time:
10 minutes

# Level of Difficulty:
Easy


# Task:
* Take a look at the code : it reads a float value, puts it into a variable named x, and prints the value of a variable named y :
```
x = float(input(“enter a float : “))
y = ###
print(y)
```
* Assign to y the following expression:
```
         3x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x – 1
```

* Keep your code clean and readable, and test it using the following data, each time assigning it to the x variable (by hardcoding it) :

```
Sample input
x = 0
x = 1
x = -1

Expected Output
y = -1.0
y = 3.0
y = -9.0
```
