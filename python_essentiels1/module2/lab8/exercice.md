* This is the code :
```
x = float(input("Enter value for x: "))
                          # put your code here
                          print("y =", y)

```

*The result should be assigned to y. 
Be careful - watch the operators and keep their priorities in mind. Don't hesitate to use as many parentheses as you need. You can use additional variables (but it's not necessary).
