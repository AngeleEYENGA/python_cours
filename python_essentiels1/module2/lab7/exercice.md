# Task:
* Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.
* The results have to be printed to the console.
* You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.
* Copy/Paste the following comment and add your code :
```
# input a float value for variable a here

# input b float value for variable b here

# output the result of addition here

# output the result of subtraction here

# output the result of multiplication here

# output the result of division here

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
```
