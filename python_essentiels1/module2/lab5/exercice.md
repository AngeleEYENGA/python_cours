# Task:
Bearing in mind that 1 miles = 1.61 kilometers.
* complete the following program so that it converts:
  * miles to kilometers;
  * kilometers to miles.

```

kilometers = 12.25 <br>
miles = 7.38 <br>
miles_to_kilometers = ### 
kilometers_to_miles = ### 
print(miles, "miles is", round(miles_to_kilometers, 2), "kilometers") 
print(kilometers, "kilometers is", round(kilometers_to_miles, 2), "miles") 
```


* Write your code in the places indicated by ###. 
* Test your program and analyze how we provide multiple arguments to the function. Note that some of the arguments inside the print() function are strings (e.g : "miles is", whereas some other are variables (e.g : miles).
