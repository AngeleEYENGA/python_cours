# Level of Difficulty:
Medium


# Task:
* Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.
* The height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately. Important : each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.
