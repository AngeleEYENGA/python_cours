# Tasks
1. Use the print() function to print the line "Hello, Python!" to the screen. Use double quotes around the string.

2. Use the print() function again, but this time print your first name.

3. Remove the double quotes and run your code. Observe Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?

4. Remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?

Experiment as much as you can:

* Change double quotes to single quotes in your print() functions.
* Use multiple print() functions on the same line.
* Use print() functions on different lines.
* Observe what happens in each case.
